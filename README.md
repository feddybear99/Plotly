### Background & Purpose ###
----------------------
ðŸ¦  ðŸ§« ðŸ§ª

Roza is interested in bacterial species that have the ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. Roza's lab has partnered with a company, Improbable beef, a food startup to research candidate species. Labs around the country have had success synthesizing meat from algae, fungi, and microorganisms found on plant roots. Beef has a signature flavor that's really hard to mimic. Roza believes that there might be a bacterial species found in the belly button that closely mimics the flavor of beef. She sampled thousands of belly buttons across the country to identify bacterial species that colonize our belly buttons. 

> The data used for this challenge was from a JSON file that contained samples of bacteria from belly buttons of hundreds of volunteers. The purpose of this challenge was to showcase the data on a webpage visualization using Plotly, JavaScript, and HTML. This website allows a participant's data to be showcased anonymously by assigning each sample to a "patient ID#" and then all relevant data for each participant would be shown on the dashboard like the example below:
